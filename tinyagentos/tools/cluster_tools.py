"""Agent tool: describe the cluster's image-generation capabilities.

Gives the agent read-only awareness of what hardware tiers exist (this host's
NPU/GPU/CPU plus any cluster workers like an NVIDIA box) and which image tools
live on each tier, including what's loaded right now. The agent uses this to
pick the best tool by intent — a fast NPU draft vs the good GPU model for a
cover — and to tell the user what it's doing.

The agent does NOT manage queues/load/unload; the scheduler + lifecycle manager
do that. This tool is the menu, not the controls.
