# Bundle assets and the SPA shell HTML must be reachable without auth so:

#   2. After a backend restart the cached shell loads immediately without
#      a round-trip that would return 401 and leave the user with a blank
#      screen instead of the cached app.
# Auth is enforced client-side: the SPA checks /auth/status on boot and
# redirects to /auth/login if there is no valid session — so dropping the
# server-side gate on the HTML does not reduce security.
# Stale-bundle risk is mitigated by __TAOS_VERSION__-namespaced SW caches:
# on activate the SW deletes any cache that does not match the current
# build token, so stale index.html entries are evicted automatically.
# /shortcut/ routes use their own taos_shortcut session cookie for auth;
# they are intentionally excluded from the main session gate here.
# /ws/ routes validate the taos_session cookie inside each endpoint handler,
# before websocket.accept() and before spawning any process. BaseHTTPMiddleware
# wrapping a WS upgrade can cause connection-level issues in some Starlette
# versions, so /ws/ remains exempt at the middleware layer; the per-endpoint
# check is the authoritative guard for all WebSocket endpoints.
