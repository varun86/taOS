"""The browser-proxy origin — a SECOND, deliberately API-free ASGI app.

Frontend win #2 background
==========================
A service worker can only intercept fetches from clients of its OWN
origin. The proxied iframe is currently same-origin with the taOS shell
but sandboxed to an OPAQUE origin (no ``allow-same-origin``), so the
shell-origin SW (``/__taos/sw.js``) never controls it.

The fix is to give the iframe a REAL, separate origin with NO taOS APIs
on it, so ``allow-same-origin`` is safe there: even if the proxied page's
JS escaped the sandbox it would only reach an origin that exposes the
proxy fetch + the service worker + a redeem endpoint, never the taOS API,
agents, secrets, or auth surface.

We achieve the separate origin with a second port (default 6970). But
that origin is cross-origin to the shell, so it never receives the
``taos_session`` cookie — which means it MUST have its own auth gate or
it becomes an open web proxy. We mirror the existing ``/shortcut/``
redeem-token pattern:

  * MAIN app (:6969) mints a short-lived signed ticket (authed endpoint
    ``/api/desktop/browser/proxy-ticket``).
  * This origin (:6970) redeems it at ``/__taos/redeem``, sets the
    ``taos_browser`` cookie, and 302s to the proxied URL.
  * Every other request on this origin requires a valid ``taos_browser``
    cookie or it is rejected with 401 (no login UI lives here, so we do
    NOT redirect to the main login).

State sharing
=============
The proxy needs the same browser cookie store / profile store / copilot
hub / auth manager as the main app so cookies and profiles stay
consistent across both origins. Rather than rebuild any of that, this
app *references the main app's ``State`` object directly* — ``app.state``
on the proxy app IS the main app's ``app.state``. The proxy app declares
no lifespan of its own; the main app's lifespan populates the shared
state before either server starts accepting requests.
