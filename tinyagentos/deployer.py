"""Agent deployment — create container, install framework, start.

Snapshot model (Phase 2.A): the container rootfs holds everything.
workspace, memory, and home live inside the container image rather than
as host-side bind mounts. The only bind mount is the trace directory
so the host trace-API can read events without incus exec per request.

See ``docs/design/architecture-pivot-v2.md`` §3 and §10 for the full
rationale. The archive unit is the container snapshot; state travels
with the container, not with separately-moved host directories.

A container produced by this deployer can be snapshot-exported as a
single tarball for atomic archive and restore.
