"""mDNS / Bonjour publisher for the taOS controller.

Advertises the running HTTP server on the local network so users on the
same LAN can browse to ``http://taos.local:<port>/`` (or discover taOS
via any Bonjour service browser) without having to know the host's IP.

Uses ``zeroconf.asyncio.AsyncZeroconf`` so registration runs on the event
loop and does not block startup. The ``server`` field on
:class:`zeroconf.ServiceInfo` is what makes ``taos.local`` resolve to the
detected primary LAN IPv4.

This is a *nice-to-have* — if multicast is disabled, a port is already
bound by another responder, or anything else goes wrong, we log and move
on. The controller's HTTP server is still reachable via its IP address.

Coexists fine with a system avahi-daemon: multiple responders on the
same multicast group is normal mDNS behaviour, not a conflict.

If two taOS instances run on the same LAN both claiming ``taos.local``,
zeroconf resolves the collision by suffixing the second one
(``taos-2.local`` etc.). No special-case code needed here — the library
handles it via ``allow_name_change``.
