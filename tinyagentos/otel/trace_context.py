"""W3C trace-context header builder — Phase 2 §4.4.

Builds the ``traceparent`` and ``X-TaOS-Conversation-Id`` headers that taOS
injects on every outbound memory call into qmd / taosmd so those backends can
nest their spans under the calling agent's OTel trace.

Contract (from taosmd/docs/otel-genai-mapping.md "Trace context propagation"):
- ``traceparent: 00-{traceId}-{spanId}-01``
  W3C Trace Context v1.  traceId = 32 hex chars (128-bit), spanId = 16 hex
  chars (64-bit), flags = 01 (sampled).
- ``X-TaOS-Conversation-Id: {conversation_id}``
  Passes the stable conversation thread id so the receiving side can attach
  ``gen_ai.conversation.id`` to its spans without parsing traceparent.

The traceId is derived deterministically from the conversation_id (SHA-256,
first 16 bytes) so the same conversation always maps to the same OTel trace,
matching the emitter's ``_make_trace_id()`` logic.  The spanId is a fresh
random 8 bytes per call (each memory call is a distinct span).

When ``conversation_id`` is None (e.g. non-contextual maintenance calls), a
random traceId is minted to maintain W3C header validity without implying a
correlation that does not exist.
