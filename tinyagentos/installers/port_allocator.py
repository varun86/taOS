"""Host-port allocation for installed apps.

Apps installed via Docker or LXC need a host port to be reachable.
Ports in the well-known / core / taOS-reserved range must never be
assigned to user-installed apps — they collide with system services.

Allocation is deterministic per app_id (stable across restarts) by
hashing the id into the high pool; if the deterministic slot is already
taken we walk forward until we find a free, non-reserved port.
