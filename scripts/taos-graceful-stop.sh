# Triggers taOS graceful shutdown via HTTP. Used by systemd stop/pre-shutdown hooks.
# Succeeds even if the API is unreachable so we don't block system reboot.
#
# --max-time is deliberately short: this runs on every `systemctl restart`, and
# if /api/system/prepare-shutdown ever hangs (it has), a long timeout strands the
# service in `deactivating` with the port dead for minutes — which also makes the
# in-app Update appear to fail, since it restarts the service. Draining must be
# best-effort and quick; anything slower belongs in an async background task.
#
# Honour the configured controller port: systemd passes TAOS_PORT into this
# hook's environment (see install-server.sh), so a custom-port install drains
# the right origin instead of a hardcoded 6969 that would silently no-op.
#
# Dedupe: both the unit ExecStop and taos-pre-shutdown.service call this script
# on a reboot. Write a stamp on success so a second invocation within 60s is
# a no-op, avoiding a double agent prepare-shutdown pass.
