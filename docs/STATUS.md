SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for cross-agent handoff.

▶ WAKE QUEUE (order per Jay 2026-06-13 22:20: "real desktop next then live wallpaper work"):
1. REAL DESKTOP feature set -- DONE this window, PR #873 OPEN: #22 dock right-click menu (Show/Min/Max/Quit/Keep-in-Dock), #23 New Folder = inline untitled folder + instant rename in real Desktop dir, #24 FS-backed desktop icons + thumbnails (open/rename/delete) + backend POST /api/workspace/rename + 4 tests. tsc/build/16 workspace tests pass. Icons/thumbnails/rename need a LIVE Pi check (preview has no backend). Merge when bot-review green.
2. LIVE WALLPAPER work (NEXT per Jay): verify tsParticles #872 LOOK live on Pi (headless can't rasterize it), then build the config sliders (#21: speed/density/glow/colour/text) -- the user/agent-authorable foundation (tsParticles engine). DO sliders only after Jay confirms the #872 look (avoid a 3rd wallpaper rejection).
3. STORE redesign #871 OPEN -- the 4 Gitar bugs are FIXED this window (search now filters Discover/Community; image-gen/voice/video-gen/plugin reachable from Apps nav; Updates honest via update_available + "up to date" empty state; RichCard reads install target at click). 42 store tests pass. Merge when bot-review green.
4. PROMO HERO PROGRAM (memory [[promo-hero-initiative]]): only the agent CHAT + a demo PROJECT stay mock; build everything else REAL. Hero = multi-window (chat + project canvas + store), 5:2 X-cut on all promo. Needs store (#871), project canvas/mind-map (#16, net-new), demo seed (#17), agent window-mgmt API (#18). Mock data PRIVATE on local `marketing` branch (never push/merge; MARKETING.md).
5. Also queued: store popularity LIVE stars backend (#13), per-app install telemetry -> the now-secured stats page (#15), widget redesign (#19, NOT in the shot), mobile audit, wallpaper picker #864, island v2 #854, GitHub #858 ph2, live-wallpaper package brainstorm.

Branch tips: master=6394a3ed. dev=4f2259a3. Merged this session: #867 #868 (theme+neural), #869 (popover/widget graphite colours), #870 (graphite static wallpaper + light/dark inversion); taos-website #5 (stats Basic Auth -> main, set STATS_USER/STATS_PASS in Coolify). Local-only `marketing` branch (private, no upstream; NEVER push/merge).

Session state: ACTIVE (autonomous overnight, 5h reset ~01:40). OPEN PRs to merge when bot-green: #871 (store redesign, 4 bugs fixed), #872 (tsParticles wallpaper, verify look live), #873 (real desktop). Next action = verify tsParticles #872 live then sliders #21. tsParticles + Safari dark<->light + live-wallpaper animation + desktop icons/thumbnails are all best checked LIVE on the Pi (preview has no backend; tsParticles canvas does not rasterize headless).

WEBSITE: taos.my live. All 4 taos-website PRs merged (stats/changelog/nav/accessibility).

CI: test suite parallelized via #839 (xdist -n auto). CodeRabbit may be out of credits -- do not merge on a fake rate-limit pass. Use @coderabbitai full review to retrigger; manual review OK for tiny already-reviewed PRs.

OPEN PRs:
- #872 feat(wallpaper): tsParticles live "Neural (Live)" wallpaper (selectable, theme-aware) -- verify look live, then sliders (#21)
- #871 feat(store): App Store redesign -- has 4 Gitar bugs for @taOS to fix before merge (see WAKE QUEUE 3)
- #846 dependabot esbuild bump -- SUPERSEDED by #849 (already on dev); close it
- #476 DRAFT feat(userspace): App Runtime v1 -- stays DRAFT, not ready to merge
(merged to dev this session: #867 #868 #869 #870 theme/wallpaper/popovers/inversion. taos-website #5 stats-auth -> main.)

Notable open issues (bugs first):
- #844 rkllama store-UI install chain broken (wrong script + non-interactive false-success) -- unresolved
- #841 update check shows no updates when local branch diverged from origin -- unresolved
- #825 taOS agent model swap breaks routing (stale per-agent key preferred over master key)
- #840 chat: per-agent framework slash commands (Telegram-style) in DMs and via @agent /
- #836 deep-navigation API for taOS agent to drive desktop (hook shipped; agent tool side pending)

Done (since last STATUS.md update):
- ALL 26 agent jobs COMPLETE and on master (via #845 batch).
- Messages-polish (#838), agent manual templates (#842), CI parallelization (#839) all merged to dev then master.
- Light theme (#848), esbuild RCE patch (#849), brand rename (#847), chat composer unified (#850), Agents redesign (#851), update flow fix (#852), Chat Slack-polish (#853), agent kill switch (#857) all on dev.
- This sweep: docs/STATUS.md (dev tip + #860), docs/agent-qmd-serve-setup.md + docs/mirror-policy.md (brand rename TinyAgentOS->taOS).

Next queue:
1. Land #859 and #860 after CI + review.
2. Close #846 (superseded by #849).
3. Fix #844 and #841 (bugs, high user impact).
4. #825 key-scope fix.
5. Desktop overhaul (#824) and widget epic: needs Jay design session first.

Decisions (carried from prior sessions):
- PR for all code changes (no direct-to-dev commits for features).
- Never --delete-branch on a dev->master PR (deletes dev, closes all dev-targeting PRs).
- Jay updates Pi manually -- do not SSH-deploy after merges.
- gh pr merge 401s -- use GitHub UI or gh api PUT for merges.

Security queue: #747 #737 #672 #658 #655 #654 #653 #651 #650 #647

GOTCHA: docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md is intentionally untracked (exposed Pi LAN IP in a prior commit; restored from memory but kept out of git). The RESTART CHECK at its top is stale (referenced #752, long-closed); ignore it.
