# Changelog

All notable changes to taOS are documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions follow semver beta: `1.0.0-beta.N`, bumped on each dev->master promotion.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-beta.8] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Install: the controller venv now uses a litellm-compatible Python (3.11 to 3.13). A fresh distro that defaults python3 to 3.14 (e.g. WSL on Ubuntu 26.04) previously aborted with "No matching distribution found for litellm>=1.89.3", because litellm supports only >=3.10,<3.14. The installer now picks a supported interpreter, installs python3.13 if none is present, and fails with a clear message otherwise; requires-python is capped at <3.14 to match.

## [1.0.0-beta.7] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Install: libtorrent is no longer a core dependency, so a fresh install no longer aborts with "No matching distribution found for libtorrent>=2.0.9" on platforms without a libtorrent wheel (e.g. WSL). It is now an optional `torrent` extra; the model torrent mesh is enabled only where the OS-level package is present, and hosts without it fall back to a direct download.

## [1.0.0-beta.6] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Coding Studio gains a model-agnostic tool-calling loop: agents read, edit, and verify files inside a workspace-jailed sandbox using filesystem tool primitives, driven by a LiteLLM-backed model step.
- Cluster capability map: worker registration and heartbeats populate a per-node capability and hardware map with admin endpoints, plus a non-destructive stale-node offline sweep.
- Append-only board audit log: every task transition is recorded, with a project-scoped activity feed and a task audit endpoint, indexed for unbounded growth.
- `taos rollback`: a CLI recovery path that restores the previous branch and version, so a broken update can be recovered even when the dashboard is unreachable.

### Changed
- One Browser app: the separate streamed-browser app is gone. The Browser app attaches a Neko streamed session through a toggle, and a RAM-capable Pi host can serve the session itself instead of reporting that it is not capable.
- The default store no longer seeds the X, Reddit, YouTube, and GitHub apps; they are optional installs.

### Fixed
- Browser sessions resolve the target worker before creating the session row, so a failed placement no longer leaves an orphaned session.
- Auto-expiring notification toasts no longer archive themselves into the History view.
- Dependabot majors updated: actions/checkout v7, dependabot/fetch-metadata v3, and the dev Python dependency group.

## [1.0.0-beta.5] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- Browser app redesigned to the current design bar with a collapsible sidebar.
- Coding Studio: workspace-scoped agent file edits with a build loop and inline diff review.

### Changed
- CI runs the test matrix on GitHub-hosted runners, cancels superseded runs per ref, and auto-merges low-risk Dependabot patch and minor updates on green.

### Fixed
- Streamed browser now connects over Tailscale and other non-LAN addresses: WebRTC advertises the single connecting-host IP, fixing the white screen the previous comma-separated NAT mapping caused.
- The "connecting" overlay can no longer hang over a session that is already live.
- Hardened the streamed-browser iframe sandbox and several store and coding-studio endpoints: IDOR guard on submission reads, symlink-safe workspace writes, and an admin gate on install-registry mutations.
- Store submissions return 400 on invalid input instead of 500.
- Security: dompurify updated to 3.4.11; cryptography and pydantic-settings advisories cleared.
- Install: the core install no longer aborts when optional components fail, and drops to the service user without assuming sudo (WSL robustness).

## [1.0.0-beta.4.1] - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Installs and in-app updates verify the prebuilt bundle's SHA256 before extracting; a corrupted or tampered bundle is rejected and falls back to a local build.
- Re-installs update the existing install in place instead of forking a second copy.

### Fixed
- Symlink-safe staging (no fixed /tmp paths as root), atomic-rename swap, and a fix so the bundle is no longer treated as perpetually stale.
- README corrected (installs download a prebuilt bundle, no local build) and links rebranded to jaylfc/taOS.

## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- "Reduce effects" toggle (Settings, Accessibility) for low-end devices: disables background blur, heavy shadows, and continuous animations for a smoother UI on older hardware.

### Changed
- The installer and in-app update download a prebuilt UI bundle instead of building it locally, so installs and upgrades are faster and no longer fail or silently stay on the old version on low-memory machines including WSL. A local build, when still needed, now fails with a clear message instead of half-updating.
- CI runs on self-hosted runners and gates the desktop test suite.

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Mobile Store redesigned into an Apple App Store-style layout: bottom tab bar (Discover/Apps/Agents/Search/Updates), a featured hero, horizontal app carousels with Get pills and star counts, full-screen search, and a device filter.
- Real cover banners and icons across the Store: OpenClaw, Hermes, Ollama, ComfyUI, n8n, and the self-hosted apps, plus a shared Stable Diffusion banner (the AUTOMATIC1111 build shown in grayscale to distinguish it). A shared AppIcon component falls back to a branded monogram when no logo exists, so no tile renders blank.

### Fixed
- Installed apps in the mobile Store no longer show a non-interactive "Open" control; they show an honest installed status.
- Failed Store installs now surface a Retry action instead of failing silently.
- Store icons and cover images reset correctly when a reused tile switches to a different app.

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Mail app with IMAP/SMTP account setup, message list, read, and send.
- Reddit, YouTube, GitHub, and X apps available as optional Store installs.
- Agent-callable screenshot endpoint for desktop-control workflows.

### Changed
- Browser app redesigned with the Store/Images design bar and taos.my set as the default homepage, with automatic dark/light scheme applied to proxied sites.
- Projects app shell redesigned with a Workspace hero tab.
- Notification bell wired to the backend feed with actionable click routing to the originating app or agent.
- Updates panel now shows version numbers (e.g. 1.0.0-beta.2) as the primary display, with commit SHAs as a secondary detail.

### Fixed
- Controller restart time reduced from ~46 s to ~7 s by eliminating the graceful-stop hang.
- Projects canvas crash caused by malformed element payloads written by agents.
- Window move and resize jitter under rapid pointer events.
